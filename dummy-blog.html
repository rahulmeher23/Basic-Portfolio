        <p>Switzerland is home to some of the best hiking trails in the world, making it an ideal destination for a hiking trip. In September I went on a girls’ wellness getaway in Switzerland where we spent eight blissful days hiking through the breathtaking Bernese Alps.</p>

        <p>The Bernese Alps are a mountain range of the alps made up of three peaks (Eiger, Mönch, and Jungfrau), located in Western Switzerland, in the canton of Bern. This area of Switzerland offers excellent skiing in the winter and incredible hiking in the summer.</p>
        
        <p><h3>Where To Stay In Switzerland</h3><br>
        The Bernese Alps are stunning and very accessible, making them an ideal destination for a Switzerland hiking trip. We chose the small village of Wengen (population 1,300), as our home base here for the duration of our getaway. Wengen is a car-free mountain town in the Interlaken area that is at the heart of summer hiking, sightseeing, and outdoor activities.</p>

        <p>In winter, Wengen transforms into a world-class ski resort famous for the Lauberhorn World Cup Alpine ski races and has excellent skiing terrain suitable for all abilities. The picturesque town of Wengen exudes Swiss mountain charm and offers an array of great hiking trails, as well as good restaurants and upscale rentals and hotels. </p>
        
        <p>We rented our chalet from Wengen Apartments and could not be more pleased with our accommodations. Julie Doyle, the owner, is wonderful and quickly responded to our requests and questions.</p>

        <p>We stayed in the Chalet Bärgsunna Penthouse which sits on a hillside overlooking Wengen, just a short walk from the Wengen–Männlichen aerial cableway. This penthouse offered the perfect mix of chic alpine decor with modern amenities and was an excellent home base for our hiking getaway.</p>

        <p><h3>How To Get To Wengen</h3><br>
         The closest airport to Wengen is Zurich International Airport (ZRH). I flew Swiss Air direct from Los Angeles to Zurich. From Zurich, it is a two-hour (beautiful!) drive to Lauterbrunnen. Wengen is a car-free town so when you arrive in Lauterbrunnen you can leave your car there at the multi-level parking garage at the Lauterbrunnen Railway Station. Parking is about $20 per day. </p>

         <p>Then you take the train up the mountain to Wengen. It is a quick ride and takes less than twenty minutes, and is about $8 for a one-way ticket. The train stops briefly at Wengwald on the way up and then the next stop is Wengen.</p>

         <p>I hope you’ve found my Switzerland hiking trip guide helpful and I hope it has inspired you to plan a trip to the Bernese Alps! It is an incredible destination and I highly suggest staying in Wengen. If you have questions please let me know in the comments below. </p>
